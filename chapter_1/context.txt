Unity 8 updated with fancy new previews
================================================================================
Ubuntu converged is the next-generation pure Ubuntu experience, convergence-enabled operating system that is to power phones, tablets and desktops with fresh, new, innovative interfaces, behaviors and capabilities.

[Unity 8][1] is a critical part of Ubuntu converged, new Unity version traversing an impressive development road across the latest months, seeing new and new features, polish and additions on a constant basis.

Unity 8 has been updated to yet-another meaningful release, introducing significantly improved and refined previews for its content (images, video clips, music tracks, etc).

Running Unity 8, navigating to the Applications scope and clicking & holding on an application, the user is to notice the revamped previews for the previewing areas with:

- images are now more clearly rendered
- the text positioned at the top of the preview has been removed
- descriptions are more readable and properly located inside the preview

essentially, a more pleasant preview view.

The newly-revamped previews have been implemented in multiple scopes, including the Videos scope, too; long-pressing on a video clip, pushes the clip into its dedicated preview, where the user is to be delighted by repositioned buttons, new listed entries with handy informations (`Format, Dimensions, Size`), relocated title, as well as by the newly-added play-like icon rendered on top of the clip's thumbnail.

Meaning, the user is now able to open video clips by both:

- hitting the `Play` button
- clicking directly on the thumbnail, action that opens the clip via the default video player

The Music scope follows the new designs, expressing its music previews with no header, resized thumbnails (filling now a more natural portion of the screen) and repositioned buttons.

Moreover, the images from the Photos scope are now exposed with the mentioned refinements, permitting more accurate observations of images with a more clean, clear look.

The new preview-wise enhancements add a significant instantly-noticeable elegance to Unity 8, while presenting items with more intuitive, easily-graspable informations, overall improvements surrounded by class and eyecandy gains.

Unity 8 is [available][2] for testing via Ubuntu 13.10's Ubuntu Software Center.
